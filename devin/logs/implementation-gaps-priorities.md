# Implementation Gaps & Priorities

This document identifies implementation gaps and priorities for the NU-DATA-UI project.

## High Priority Implementation Gaps

1. **Layout Structure**
   - Implement MainLayout, DashboardLayout, and DataViewLayout
   - Ensure proper responsiveness across all breakpoints
   - Add layout switching based on route configuration

2. **Routing System**
   - Create dedicated routing configuration separate from App.tsx
   - Implement route guards for authentication
   - Set up nested routes with code splitting
   - Add breadcrumb support using route hierarchy

3. **Dark Mode Theming**
   - Implement ThemeContext for application-wide theme state
   - Extract Figma color tokens for consistent theming
   - Add dark mode toggle component
   - Update all components to support both light and dark themes

4. **Missing UI Components**
   - DataTable with pagination and sorting
   - FilterPanel for data filtering
   - Empty state components for tables and lists

## Implementation Priorities for Session M4

1. Complete layout component implementation
2. Set up routing configuration and route guards
3. Implement dark mode theming
4. Update existing components for dark mode support
5. Create DataTable and FilterPanel components
