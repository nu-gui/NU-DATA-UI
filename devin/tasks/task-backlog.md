# Task Backlog - Placeholder Functions & Future Work

This file tracks identified placeholder code, mock implementations, and TODO comments that require future development work.

## Completed Tasks (Session: 2025-04-15)

1.  **✅ Replace Mock User Service:**
    *   **File:** <ref_file file="/home/ubuntu/repos/NU-DATA-UI/src/auth/controllers/auth.controller.ts" />
    *   **Context:** The `mockUserService` object provided hardcoded user data and simple logging for functions.
    *   **Resolution:** Created proper `UserService` class in `src/auth/services/user.service.ts` with methods for finding users, updating passwords, and storing reset tokens. Updated `AuthController` to use the new service.

2.  **✅ Use Theme Colors in Animations:**
    *   **File:** <ref_file file="/home/ubuntu/repos/NU-DATA-UI/src/animations/animations.ts" />
    *   **Context:** The `successState` and `errorState` animation variants used hardcoded hex color values.
    *   **Resolution:** Refactored these animation definitions to use Tailwind theme tokens (`rgb(var(--color-green-50) / 1)` and `rgb(var(--color-red-50) / 1)`).

3.  **✅ Document TypeScript Dependencies:**
    *   **File:** <ref_file file="/home/ubuntu/repos/NU-DATA-UI/docs/dependencies/typescript-dependencies.md" />
    *   **Context:** Missing type definitions and dependencies were causing TypeScript errors.
    *   **Resolution:** Created documentation explaining that all required dependencies are installed in package.json and providing resolution steps for TypeScript configuration issues.

4.  **✅ Implement Dark Mode Support:**
    *   **File:** <ref_file file="/home/ubuntu/repos/NU-DATA-UI/src/context/ThemeContext.tsx" />
    *   **Context:** The current theme implementation needed to be extended to support dark mode.
    *   **Resolution:** Created ThemeContext and ThemeToggle components, updated theme-variables.css for dark mode, and configured Tailwind for class-based dark mode support.

5.  **✅ Implement Layout Structure:**
    *   **File:** <ref_file file="/home/ubuntu/repos/NU-DATA-UI/src/components/layout/layouts/MainLayout.tsx" />
    *   **Context:** The application needed a consistent layout structure for all pages.
    *   **Resolution:** Implemented MainLayout, DashboardLayout, and DataViewLayout components based on Figma designs and integrated with routing.

6.  **✅ Implement Routing Configuration:**
    *   **File:** <ref_file file="/home/ubuntu/repos/NU-DATA-UI/src/routes/index.tsx" />
    *   **Context:** The application needed a structured routing system with nested routes and route guards.
    *   **Resolution:** Created a dedicated routing configuration with nested routes, route guards, and code-splitting support.

## Remaining Tasks (Session: 2025-04-15)

1.  **Implement High-Priority Components:**
    *   **Context:** The Feature Matrix identifies several high-priority components that need implementation.
    *   **Task:** Continue implementing components based on the priority list in the Feature Matrix.

2.  **Enhance Card Component:**
    *   **Context:** The Card component has been implemented but could benefit from additional features.
    *   **Task:** Add support for custom animations, interactive states, and additional variants.

3.  **Implement Dashboard Widgets:**
    *   **Context:** The dashboard needs interactive widgets for displaying metrics and data visualizations.
    *   **Task:** Implement dashboard widgets with real-time data support and customizable display options.

4.  **Add Form Components:**
    *   **Context:** The application needs standardized form components for data entry and validation.
    *   **Task:** Implement form components with validation, error handling, and accessibility support.

## Next Session Focus

The next session (M5) should focus on implementing user dashboard with live widgets and summary metrics, continuing work on batch import/export pages, and introducing campaign feedback visualization in dashboard widgets.
