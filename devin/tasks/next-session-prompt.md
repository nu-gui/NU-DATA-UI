# üéûÔ∏è Session ANIM-2 ‚Äì Addressing Placeholders and Next Steps

‚ö° Session 3: (To be determined based on priorities)
Repository: nu-gui/NU-DATA-UI

## üéØ Previous Session Summary (ANIM-1)
- **Objective:** Integrate responsive, accessible animations using `ResponsiveAnimation.tsx`.
- **Branch:** `feat/anim1-responsive-animation`
- **Pull Request:** <https://github.com/nu-gui/NU-DATA-UI/pull/82>
- **Key Outcomes:**
    - Integrated `ResponsiveAnimation` wrapper into core layout and surface components (`Card`, `PageContainer`, `Widget`, `DashboardCard`, `ExportAnalyticsDashboard`).
    - Centralized animation logic in `animations.ts` and `easings.ts`.
    - Implemented `useReducedMotion` and updated `useMediaQuery` for accessibility and responsiveness.
    - Updated `StateTransition` and `PageTransition` to use the new system.
    - Removed legacy Tailwind keyframe animations.
    - Created initial documentation (`README.md`, `CHANGES.md`, `devin/logs/AI-Task-History.md`).
    - Scanned for placeholder code and documented findings in <ref_file file="/home/ubuntu/repos/NU-DATA-UI/devin/tasks/task-backlog.md" />.

## üß† Current State & Backlog
- PR #82 contains the completed animation integration work and is ready for review.
- The <ref_file file="/home/ubuntu/repos/NU-DATA-UI/devin/tasks/task-backlog.md" /> outlines several areas with placeholder code or TODOs:
    - Mock user service in `auth.controller.ts`.
    - Hardcoded theme colors in `animations.ts`.
    - Potential dependency/type definition issues (`@types/node`, `crypto`, `jsonwebtoken`, `bcrypt`, `express`, `framer-motion`).

## üöÄ Next Session Objectives (Suggestions - Prioritize with User)

**Option 1: Address High-Priority Placeholders**
- **Focus:** Resolve critical placeholder implementations identified in the backlog.
- **Tasks:**
    - Replace mock user service in `auth.controller.ts` with actual service integration (requires backend coordination).
    - Resolve missing type definitions and dependencies to ensure clean builds and type checking.

**Option 2: Continue Animation Integration**
- **Focus:** Apply animations to remaining priority components identified in the initial ANIM-1 prompt.
- **Tasks:**
    - Integrate `ResponsiveAnimation` or `StateTransition` into:
        - `StatusCard.tsx`
        - `QuickActions.tsx`
        - `ActivityFeed.tsx`
        - `SearchResults.tsx`
        - `Chart.tsx` (focus on `StateTransition` for data updates)
    - Refine existing animations based on feedback from PR #82 review.

**Option 3: Theme Integration for Animations**
- **Focus:** Connect animation states (success/error) to the application's theme.
- **Tasks:**
    - Investigate how theme colors are managed (e.g., CSS variables, Tailwind theme config).
    - Update `animations.ts` to use theme tokens instead of hardcoded colors.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup for Next Session
1.  Sync local `main` branch with the remote repository (`git checkout main && git pull origin main`).
2.  Create a new feature branch for the session (e.g., `git checkout -b feat/anim2-placeholder-fixes` or similar based on chosen focus).
3.  Review the latest `main` branch and any feedback on PR #82.
4.  Confirm the primary objective for this session with the user.
