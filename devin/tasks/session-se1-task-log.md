# Session SE1 - Auth & RBAC Control Flow Implementation

## Overview
This session implements the authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) functionality for the NU-DATA-UI platform. The implementation includes JWT bearer authentication, password hashing, multi-tenant token scoping, and role-based access control.

## Completed Tasks
- Created user model with roles (admin, user, readonly)
- Implemented JWT token generation and verification
- Created password hashing and comparison utilities
- Implemented authentication middleware
- Created role-based access control guards
- Implemented tenant isolation middleware
- Created authentication controllers for login, logout, and password reset
- Implemented authentication routes
- Created main application and server files

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
- JWT Bearer token authentication
- Token payload includes user ID, email, role, and tenant ID
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Token expiry management
- Multi-tenant token scoping

### Role-Based Access Control
- Three user roles: admin, user, readonly
- Admin role has access to all resources
- User role has limited access based on permissions
- Readonly role has read-only access to resources
- Role guard middleware to protect routes

### API Endpoints
- POST /api/v1/auth/login - User login
- POST /api/v1/auth/logout - User logout
- POST /api/v1/auth/password/reset - Request password reset
- POST /api/v1/auth/password/reset/:token - Reset password

## Next Steps
- Implement database integration for user management
- Create user service for database operations
- Implement token blacklisting for enhanced security
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Create unit and integration tests
