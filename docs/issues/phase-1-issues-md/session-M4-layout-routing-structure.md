## Acceptance Criteria
- Layout components render correctly and are responsive
- Routing system works with nested routes and code splitting
- Dark mode toggle switches between themes correctly
- High-priority components are implemented and styled correctly
- All components support both light and dark themes
- Unit tests pass for all new components
