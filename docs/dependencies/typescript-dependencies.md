# TypeScript Dependencies Documentation

## Overview
This document provides information about the TypeScript dependencies used in the NU-DATA-UI project, including their purpose and current status.

## Dependencies Status

### Runtime Dependencies
These dependencies are required for the application to run:

| Dependency | Version | Status | Purpose |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|
| express | ^5.1.0 | Installed | Web framework for Node.js |
| jsonwebtoken | ^9.0.2 | Installed | JWT token generation and verification |
| bcrypt | ^5.1.1 | Installed | Password hashing and comparison |
| framer-motion | ^12.6.5 | Installed | Animation library for React |
| crypto | Built-in Node.js module | Available | Cryptographic functionality |

### TypeScript Type Declarations
These type declaration packages provide TypeScript type definitions for JavaScript libraries:

| Dependency | Version | Status | Purpose |
|------------|---------|--------|---------|
| @types/node | ^20.6.0 | Installed | TypeScript definitions for Node.js |
| @types/express | ^5.0.1 | Installed | TypeScript definitions for Express |
| @types/jsonwebtoken | ^9.0.9 | Installed | TypeScript definitions for jsonwebtoken |
| @types/bcrypt | ^5.0.2 | Installed | TypeScript definitions for bcrypt |

## Known Issues

Despite having all the necessary dependencies installed, TypeScript may still report errors about missing modules. This is likely due to one of the following reasons:

1. **TypeScript Configuration**: The `tsconfig.json` file may need to be updated to properly recognize the installed type declarations.
2. **Import Path Issues**: The import paths in the code may not match the expected paths for the installed modules.
3. **Module Resolution**: The TypeScript module resolution strategy may need to be adjusted.

## Resolution Steps

To resolve TypeScript errors related to missing modules:

1. Verify that the `tsconfig.json` file includes the following settings:
   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "moduleResolution": "node",
       "esModuleInterop": true,
       "resolveJsonModule": true,
       "types": ["node", "express", "jsonwebtoken", "bcrypt"]
     }
   }
   ```

2. For the built-in Node.js `crypto` module, ensure that `@types/node` is properly installed and configured.

3. For any remaining issues, consider adding the following to the top of files with import errors:
   ```typescript
   /// <reference types="node" />
   /// <reference types="express" />
   /// <reference types="jsonwebtoken" />
   /// <reference types="bcrypt" />
   ```

4. If issues persist, run the following command to reinstall the type declarations:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @types/node @types/express @types/jsonwebtoken @types/bcrypt
   ```

## Conclusion

All required dependencies for the NU-DATA-UI project are properly installed according to the `package.json` file. Any TypeScript errors related to missing modules are likely configuration issues rather than missing dependencies.
