# NU-DATA-UI Phase 2 Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the planned development activities for Phase 2 of the NU-DATA-UI platform, building upon the foundation established in Phase 1. Phase 2 focuses on expanding the component library, enhancing animations, completing design token exports, and developing the Admin Portal.

## Key Objectives

1. **Component Library Expansion**
   - Implement all remaining UI components from the Figma design system
   - Ensure responsive behavior across all device sizes
   - Maintain design fidelity with the Figma specifications

2. **Animation System Enhancement**
   - Apply the ResponsiveAnimation component throughout the application
   - Optimize animations for performance and accessibility
   - Create a consistent animation language across the platform

3. **Design Token Completion**
   - Export and implement all remaining design tokens
   - Ensure proper theming support including dark mode
   - Create a comprehensive design token documentation

4. **Admin Portal Development**
   - Build the tenant management interface
   - Implement user and role management
   - Create system configuration and monitoring tools
