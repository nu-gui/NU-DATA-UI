## 🔗 Interdependencies
- `R1` governs scope and roadmap used in all others
- `M1`, `B1`, `DA1` form the structural foundation
- `SE1` secures backend routes and UI session handling
- `T1` and `D1` support quality gates and test automation
- `LLM1`, `DS1`, and `PY1` handle enrichment logic and scoring insights
- `MW1` connects frontend/middleware to backend Python runners
- `X1` utilities support API/middleware/tests universally
- `I1` enables local full-stack testing and continuous dev workflows

## 🧪 Validation Flow
1. Dev/Test Environments: `I1`
2. API/Schema Integration: `B1`, `DA1`
3. UI Rendering + Auth: `M1`, `SE1`
4. Enrichment Processing: `LLM1`, `PY1`, `MW1`
5. Exporting + Metrics: `DS1`
6. Quality Gates + Pipelines: `T1`, `D1`
7. Utility Injection: `X1`

## 🚀 Execution Ready
All Phase 1 session `.md` documents have been generated, linked, and optionally converted to GitHub Issues. These serve as scoped dev tickets that can be assigned to human or AI contributors (e.g. Devin). Execution can now proceed via `app.devin.ai` sessions or GitHub Project automations.

> ⚙️ Tip: Use the provided PowerShell script `github_phase1_bulk_issues.ps1` to automate issue creation from session logs.
