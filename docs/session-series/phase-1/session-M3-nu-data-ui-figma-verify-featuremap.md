## 🎯 Objective

Verify the completeness of all Figma design exports, map them to the current NU-DATA-UI codebase, and implement a key Figma component using React/Tailwind. Resolve outstanding placeholder implementations and dependency issues where applicable.

---

## 📆 Scope

### ✏️ Design Audit
- ✅ Validated presence of all exported Figma components, styles, and assets in `design-data/`
- ✅ Confirmed Git LFS tracks large assets (SVG, PNG, JSON)
- ✅ Used Figma VS Code plugin to compare exported components to the source file (`KNF6khJCFlopk2BYGz7YZB`)
- ✅ Completed extraction of 24 low-priority decorative components
- ✅ Confirmed `extraction-summary.json` reports 100% success

### 📃 Design-to-Code Mapping
- ✅ Created full inventory of Figma elements in `devin/logs/figma-design-inventory.md`
- ✅ Mapped exported components to implemented React/Tailwind components
- ✅ Documented gaps and assigned implementation priorities in `devin/logs/implementation-gaps-priorities.md`
- ✅ Created Feature Matrix linking design routes/pages to implemented components in `devin/logs/component-feature-matrix.md`

### ⚙️ Component Integration
- ✅ Selected `Card` as high-priority component for implementation
- ✅ Extracted React/Tailwind implementation via Figma VS Code plugin to `design-data/manual-extraction/components/card/`
- ✅ Integrated Card component in the codebase at `src/components/elements/Card.tsx` with demo and test components
- ✅ Documented integration process in `devin/docs/component-integration-template.md`

### ⚠️ Placeholder Resolution
- ✅ Replaced `mockUserService` in `auth.controller.ts` with proper `UserService` implementation
- ✅ Refactored `successState` and `errorState` in `animations.ts` to use Tailwind theme tokens
- ✅ Documented TypeScript dependencies in `docs/dependencies/typescript-dependencies.md`:
  - All required dependencies (`@types/node`, `crypto`, `jsonwebtoken`, `bcrypt`, `express`, `framer-motion`) are installed

---

## 🔗 Dependencies
- ✅ PR #6 (Figma export script enhancements)
- ✅ PR #9 (asset extraction pipeline)
- ⚠️ Builds on: `session-ANIM-1`
- ⚡ Blocks: Dark mode token config and final Storybook documentation

---

## 💡 Implementation Notes

**Key Scripts:**
```bash
node scripts/authenticate-figma.js
node scripts/export-full-figma-files.js
node scripts/extract-all-figma-assets.js
```

**Confirm Success:**
```bash
cat design-data/extraction-summary.json
find design-data -name "*component*" | wc -l
```

**Docs to Update:**
- `devin/logs/figma-design-verification-report.md`
- `devin/logs/component-feature-matrix.md`
- `devin/tasks/task-backlog.md`
- `devin/docs/component-integration-template.md`

---

## 📊 Testing & Validation
- [x] Unit & snapshot tests for Card component created in `src/components/elements/CardTest.tsx`
- [x] Design fidelity cross-check completed and documented in `devin/logs/card-component-validation.md`
- [x] Responsive design implementation with Tailwind breakpoints
- [x] Accessibility compliance with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

---

## 🚧 Next Steps
- ✅ Finalized extraction with 100% component coverage
- ✅ Created comprehensive Feature Matrix for component prioritization
- ✅ Implemented Card component with Tailwind theme tokens
- ✅ Resolved placeholder implementations and documented dependencies
- Schedule session `M4` for layout and routing structure
- Initiate dark mode integration using Figma token export
- Continue implementing high-priority components based on Feature Matrix
