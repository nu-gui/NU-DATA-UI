## 🎯 Objective

Verify the completeness of all Figma design exports, map them to the current NU-DATA-UI codebase, and implement a key Figma component using React/Tailwind. Resolve outstanding placeholder implementations and dependency issues where applicable.

---

## 📆 Scope

### ✏️ Design Audit
- Validate presence of all exported Figma components, styles, and assets in `design-data/`
- Confirm Git LFS tracks large assets (SVG, PNG, JSON)
- Use Figma VS Code plugin to compare exported components to the source file (`KNF6khJCFlopk2BYGz7YZB`)
- Complete extraction of 24 low-priority decorative components
- Confirm `extraction-summary.json` reports 100% success

### 📃 Design-to-Code Mapping
- Create full inventory of Figma elements
- Map exported components to implemented React/Tailwind components
- Document gaps and assign implementation priorities
- Create a Feature Matrix linking design routes/pages to implemented components

### ⚙️ Component Integration
- Choose one high-priority component (e.g., `Card`, `Sidebar`, or `Widget`)
- Extract its React/Tailwind implementation via Figma VS Code plugin
- Integrate it in the codebase and validate against design
- Document integration process in `devin/docs/component-integration-template.md`

### ⚠️ Placeholder Resolution
- Replace `mockUserService` in `auth.controller.ts` with backend service placeholder
- Refactor `successState` and `errorState` in `animations.ts` to use theme tokens
- Document or resolve missing TypeScript dependencies:
  - `@types/node`, `crypto`, `jsonwebtoken`, `bcrypt`, `express`, `framer-motion`

## 🔗 Dependencies
- ✅ PR #6 (Figma export script enhancements)
- ✅ PR #9 (asset extraction pipeline)
- ⚠️ Builds on: `session-ANIM-1`
- ⚡ Blocks: Dark mode token config and final Storybook documentation

## 💡 Implementation Notes

**Key Scripts:**
```bash
node scripts/authenticate-figma.js
node scripts/export-full-figma-files.js
node scripts/extract-all-figma-assets.js
```

**Confirm Success:**
```bash
cat design-data/extraction-summary.json
find design-data -name "*component*" | wc -l
```

**Docs to Update:**
- `devin/logs/figma-design-verification-report.md`
- `devin/logs/component-feature-matrix.md`
- `devin/tasks/task-backlog.md`
- `devin/docs/component-integration-template.md`

---

## 📊 Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit & snapshot tests for selected component
- [ ] Storybook validation
- [ ] Design fidelity cross-check
- [ ] Responsive and accessibility compliance

---

## 🚧 Next Steps
- Finalize and merge extraction patch PR
- Schedule session `M4` for layout and routing structure
- Initiate dark mode integration using Figma token export
- Use completed Feature Matrix to prioritize missing components
