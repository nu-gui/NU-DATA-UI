# ‚úÖ Full Project Overview: NU DATA UI Platform

The NU DATA UI system is a **multi-tenant SaaS platform** designed to centralize and streamline **data enrichment, contact management, campaign analytics, and external system integrations** (via FTP/Webhooks). It supports **complex list handling**, **RPC/WPC scoring**, and **data segmentation** ‚Äî all controlled through a React-based frontend and a Node.js backend architecture powered by a PostgreSQL database.

## üß† Core Features & Functional Modules

### 1. **Login & Authentication**
- Standard login + "Remember Me" and "Forgot Password"
- Supports JWT Bearer Tokens
- Multi-tenant login structure with admin/user roles

---

### 2. **Dashboard**
- Central widget system showing:
  - Data Health Checks
  - Campaign Success Rates
  - Recent Activity Logs
  - Quick Import Access
- Highly visual with metrics and summaries (charts and tables)
- Direct shortcuts to frequently used workflows (import, search, credit request)

---

### 3. **List Management**
**Three key subpages:**
- **Controlled Data Lists** ‚Äì Source (raw) imports
- **Enriched Data Lists** ‚Äì Post-processing results
- **Outcomes** ‚Äì Outcome feedback & campaign metadata

**Functionalities include:**
- List creation, editing, deletion
- Inline table expansion to show:
  - Metadata
  - Import connection details
- Tagging, segmenting, and country/network code association

### 4. **Data Enrichment Plans**
- Wizard-based workflow:
  1. Plan Setup
  2. Pre-Processing Tasks
  3. Processing Tasks
  4. Post-Processing Tasks
  5. Review & Save
- Key tasks:
  - Deduplication
  - Column-specific filtering
  - Reverse Number Lookup
  - Full name cleanup
  - RPC scoring + name ranking
- Batch queue system for processing
- Real-time status tracking: **In-Queue, Scheduled, Completed, Paused**

---

### 5. **Data Groups**
- User-created or system-generated (auto) groups:
  - **Manual**: Filtered by date, tag, enrichment plan, phone number DCode
  - **Auto**: 
    - **DCode Grouping** ‚Äì Country/operator breakdown
    - **RPC/WPC Grouping** ‚Äì Based on reverse lookup scoring
- **Split contact lists** based on Right/Wrong Party scoring
- Export and security-controlled access to sensitive contact info

---

### 6. **Connections**
- Supports creating Import/Export connections using:
  - **Webhook**
  - **Secure FTP**
- Configurable for:
  - Control list ingestion
  - Outcome/result return
- Integrated setup wizard for mapping fields
- Re-usable templates for column mappings

---

### 7. **Import / Export**
- Supports:
  - File uploads (manual or FTP)
  - API-based imports
- Wizard with 4 steps:
  1. Filter lists
  2. Choose fields
  3. Choose export method (Download, Webhook, FTP)
  4. Confirm
- Real-time export filtering:
  - Tags, dates, enrichment plans, country/network
- Secure PIN confirmation for sensitive data operations

---

### 8. **He-Man Search**
- Federated search across:
  - Lists
  - Tags
  - Campaign outcomes
